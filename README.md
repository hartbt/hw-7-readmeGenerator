# **Description**

This assignment serves as a README.md generator using node.js. After the user runs the command "node index.js" they are prompted with various questions such as: "Enter a brief description", "Title of the project", etc. After all of the prompts are run, the generateMarkdown.js file takes all of the input and writes the information to a README.md.

# **Installation**

N/A

# **Usage**

When the webpage is loaded, the user is able to run the command "node index.js", and from there the user will be prompted with numerous questions. 

# **Technologies Used**

This application takes advantage of markdown language, Javascript, as well as NODE.js.

All three technologies are used in tandem in order to take information received using node, translate it into markdown, and then use javascript to populate a page. 

# **Problems Faced**

This assignment was fairly easy to complete with the help of my classmates. 

I was never able to get the page to correctly display the the badge information.

# **Credits**

Though this website was created by me, it was only done so using knowledge provided by many of my classmates as well as my tutor.
